# 12: Caucasus and Middle East

The Geographic region of the Caucasus and Middle East consists of six different countries - Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Iran. The most extensive orographic unit of this region is the Caucasus mountains which consist of two separate mountain systems: the Greater Caucasus and the Lesser Caucasus. The Greater Caucasus is the highest part of the Caucasus region extending for about 1300 km from northwest to southeast between the Black and Caspian seas, while the Lesser Caucasus has located approximately 100 km to the south and is characterized by relatively lower elevations. About 95% of modern glaciers of the Caucasus and Middle East region are concentrated in the Greater Caucasus.

Glacier locations and changes between RGI6 and RGI7.
:::

The RGI7 Glacier outlines for the Greater Caucasus were manually digitized by {cite:t}`Tielidze2022`. The primary source of the database was Landsat scenes from 1999-2002. Glaciers of the Middle East have also been revised in detail and digitized based on Landsat imagery from 1998-2001. Overall, glacier outlines from the Caucasus and Middle East region in RGI7 dates range between 1998 and 2002, with most of the area dating to 2000. 

This inventory represents a considerable change and improvement to RGI6. The Greater Caucasus inventory was created based on ASTER and Landsat imagery from 1999–2004 {cite:p}`Khromova2016a`. The dataset was incomplete and RGI6 incorporated "nominal glaciers" (circles covering an area equivalent to glacier size) in the eastern and western Greater Caucasus sections {cite:p}`Tielidze2018`. The RGI6 outlines also had inconsistent geolocation. Most of the glacier outlines for the Middle East in RGI6 were mapped based on the ASTER imagery from 2004-2006 (Turkey) and Landsat scenes from 2011 (Iran). A closer look revealed that most of these outlines were digitized based on snow patches and not actual glaciers.

```{admonition} Version history
:class: note, dropdown

Changes from Version 5.0 to 6.0
: The 37 nominal glaciers in Iran, derived from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`, were replaced by 200 glacier outlines submitted to GLIMS by Neamat Karimi (Ministry of Energy, Teheran).

Changes from Version 4.0 to 5.0
: Links were added to 7 glaciers in the WGMS mass-balance database.

Changes from Version 3.2 to 4.0
: One exterior GLIMSId was replaced. Topographic and hypsometric attributes were added.<br/>As noted by {cite:t}`Shahgedanova2014`, version 3.2 omitted glaciers in the western and eastern Greater Caucasus. These omissions have been partly rectified by adding nominal glaciers from WGI-XF {cite:t}`Cogley2009a`. The 339 added glaciers, with date ranges 1965–1976, cover 155 km2 and also include some in the central Greater Caucasus (on the Svanets and Lechkhum Ranges to the south of the main ridge of the Caucasus) and in the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia.

Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.2
: None.

Changes from Version 2.0 to Version 3.0
: Outlines of the glaciers of Turkey were provided by M.A. Sarıkaya {cite:p}`Sarkaya2014`.

Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0
: The 37 glaciers of Iran (12-02) were added as nominal circles from {cite:t}`Moussavi2009`.The information available for Turkey {cite:p}`Kurter1991` was not adequate for placing the individual glaciers, which have a total area of 22.9 km2.

Version 1.0
: Outlines of glaciers in the Caucasus were obtained from the GLIMS database.
